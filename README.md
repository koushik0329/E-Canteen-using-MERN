Implementing a mobile kitchen using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) involves a backend server using Node.js and Express.js, connecting it to a MongoDB database, and developing a frontend user interface using React.js. The Versions used in this web application are Node js (version 16.16.0) and MongoDB (version 6.0.4) and node packages in both server and client are installed by the command npm install in the terminal and also MongoDB Compass( version 1.35.0) is used and URI “mongodb://localhost:27017” is used in server. We can also use MongoDB shell if Mongodb compass doesn’t support in your system.
