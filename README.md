Implementing a mobile kitchen using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) involves a backend server using Node.js and Express.js, connecting it to a MongoDB database, and developing a frontend user interface using React.js. The Versions used in this web application are Node js (version 16.16.0) and MongoDB (version 6.0.4) and node packages in both server and client are installed by the command npm install in the terminal and also MongoDB Compass( version 1.35.0) is used and URI “mongodb://localhost:27017” is used in server. We can also use MongoDB shell if Mongodb compass doesn’t support in your system.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach this implementation:

How to run the web application
1. Install Visual Studio code.
2. Install node onto your system.
3. Open the terminal.
4. Go to the client folder in the project directory.
5. Run ‘npm install’ to download all the dependencies.
6. Open another terminal/Windows powershell.
7. Go to the server folder in the project directory.
8. Run npm install to download all the dependencies and libraries required.
9. Now run npm start on both the terminals simultaneously.
10. The server will start running and the website will open on localhost on the browser.
11. Open the browser and access the website to use the features of the web-app
